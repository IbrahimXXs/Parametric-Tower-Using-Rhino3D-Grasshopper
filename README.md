# Parametric Tower Design with Rhino3D & Grasshopper

## Overview

### *Parametric Tower project, a creative exploration using Rhino3D and Grasshopper to design a dynamic and responsive architectural structure. This repository contains the source code, documentation, and resources related to the project.*

#### Features

- **Parametric Design:** Leverage the power of Rhino3D and Grasshopper for intricate control over design parameters.
  
- **Responsive Structure:** Explore a dynamic tower that adapts to contextual influences and user requirements.
  
- **Computational Creativity:** Witness the convergence of form, function, and aesthetic allure through generative algorithms.

#### Prerequisites

- [Rhino3D](https://www.rhino3d.com/)
- [Grasshopper](https://www.grasshopper3d.com/)

#### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
